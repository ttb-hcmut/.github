# Microcluster

A suite of tools to distribute your programs to a cluster of microcontrollers, for machine learning and scientific computation.

[Microcluster Execute](./microcluster_exec) is a Python / OCaml interpreter that dissects your program and orchestrates distributed tasks with a micro-cluster. It is written in OCaml.

[Microcluster Canvas](./microcluster_canvas) is a library for declaring parallelizable functions to be distributed to a micro-cluster. Currently has binding for Python.
